<p align='center' style="text-align:center;font-size:1em;">
  

In this project, I implemented an efficient dynamic graph from scratch. It includes functionalities such as insertion, deletion, and more, all with efficient running times. Additionally, it has the ability to construct rooted trees with additional implementations, including:
- Printing by layer
- Pre-order printing
- Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm
- 
For the full specifications and running times of each method, please visit the corresponding section below.
