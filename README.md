<p align='center' style="text-align:center;font-size:1em;">
  

In this project, I implemented an efficient dynamic graph from scratch. It includes functionalities such as insertion, deletion, and more, all with efficient running times. Additionally, it has the ability to construct rooted trees with additional implementations, including:
- Printing by layer
- Pre-order printing
- Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm

This project is written in Java and covers key concepts of OOP programming such as inheritance, generics, and more. It also delves into fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, such as graph theory and efficient programming techniques.
For the full specifications and running times of each method, please visit the corresponding section below.
Also, if you are interested in using the code and want to test it, you can follow the instructions below.
